Revision history for Dancer-Session-Storable

0.04    2011-03-29
        Use $class->session_name to retrieve the session, for a safe default
        session name if sessin_name hasn't been configured.  Thanks to alexrj.

0.03    2011-03-25
        Use the session_name (e.g. dancer.session, or the value of the
        session_name config setting) for the session filename.  NOTE: this is
        mildly backwards-incompatible, in that upgrading will mean that existing
        sessions will not be recognised.
        Resolves GH #1, thanks to alexrj
        Minor bugfix: call $self->id, not $self->{id}, thanks Puneet Kishor

0.02    2011-03-11
        Bugfix: call SUPER::init() first, to initialise session engine
        appropriately.  Thanks to Alessandro Ranellucci ("Sound" on IRC) for
        this.
