Revision history for Dancer-Session-Storable

0.06    2012-11-26
        Fix log message on startup, thanks to Vernon (VLYON) in RT #81464

0.05    2011-10-07
        Use lock_nstore and lock_retrieve to avoid problems with multiple
        processes trying to read the session at the same time.
        Reported by onelesd in Issue 672 @ sukria/Dancer on GitHub - thanks!

        Use $class->session_name to retrieve the session, for a safe default
        session name if sessin_name hasn't been configured.  Thanks to alexrj.

0.03    2011-03-25
        Use the session_name (e.g. dancer.session, or the value of the
        session_name config setting) for the session filename.  NOTE: this is
        mildly backwards-incompatible, in that upgrading will mean that existing
        sessions will not be recognised.
        Resolves GH #1, thanks to alexrj
        Minor bugfix: call $self->id, not $self->{id}, thanks Puneet Kishor

0.02    2011-03-11
        Bugfix: call SUPER::init() first, to initialise session engine
        appropriately.  Thanks to Alessandro Ranellucci ("Sound" on IRC) for
        this.

0.01    2010-02-18
        First version released.
